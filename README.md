# RFM_Analysis_Model__PROJECT
I have created a project to analyse the RFM(i.e. Recency,Frequency,Monetary value ) which ia a finance/Marketing project and it will tell the company or organisation about the preference that should be given to customers based on their RFM scores using python and several python packages like Pandas,plotly.
I have tried to explain each of the code and their output as well.
